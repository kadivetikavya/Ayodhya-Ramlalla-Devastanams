        <h2>Sree Hanuman Garhi</h2>
    <p>Hanuman Garhi is a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman. A very significant belief, as well as a custom here, is that before worshipping Lord Rama, one must visit Hanuman Garhi and venerate Lord Hanuman first. Hanuman Ji is considered an ardent devotee or bhakt of Lord Rama, therefore before worshipping Rama, one must worship his devotees first. Lord Hanuman is one of the avatars of Lord Shiva. He has been worshipped in this place since the 10th century, but the temple was constructed later on. There had been instances where this temple was on the edge of demolition, but with the sheer will of its devotees and by the blessing of Lord Ram, the demolition never happened. It is believed that Lord Hanuman resided in this place, (earlier it was a cave), in order to protect Ramkot, which is the birthplace of Lord Rama. Hanuman Garhi is located only 1 km away from Ram Janmabhoomi.</p>
